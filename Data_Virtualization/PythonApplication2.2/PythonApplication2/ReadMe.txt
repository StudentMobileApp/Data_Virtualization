GENERAL USE

*Keep in mind that this solution was created using my version of VS2017 
with the Python Extentions that I installed. Where you have "Python.h",
in particular, may be in a different location (or mulpile locations). 
As I've loaded this solution in branch on our gitHub, I included the 
settings. I don't know if that will work or not. Use what you're c
omfortable with.


FROM WITHIN SOLUTION

*Right click on .py file and select "Set as StartUp File" to run project.
*Ignore build errors. In Python, it will only run what's in the "start up" 
file.


ADDITIONAL NOTES

*Directed and Undirected projects use task1 data. These are network graphs.
*CallTest (my attempt at connecting Python and C++) is not working, yet....
